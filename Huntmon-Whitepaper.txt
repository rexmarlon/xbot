The governance system consists of two bodies:
1. Upper House (Council of $HMON Holders):
37
○ Representation: $HMON governance token holders.
○ Voting weighting: Logarithmically based on the number of $HMON tokens
held.
○ Tasks: Decisions on economic aspects, budget approvals, adjustments to
tokenomics and approval of important updates.
2. Lower House (Players Council):
○ Representation: All active players, regardless of their investments.
○ Voting weighting: "One Player, One Vote".
○ Tasks: Decisions on gameplay aspects, community features and feedback on
team members.
Voting processes
1. Proposal submission:
● Any player or $HMON holder can submit suggestions.
● Proposals must be submitted by a minimum number of supporters (e.g. 10% of
players or $HMON holders).
2. Discussion phase:
● Before each vote, there is an open discussion period (e.g. 7 days) during which
feedback can be collected and the proposal can be adjusted.
3. Vote:
● Quorum: At least 20% of voting players or $HMON holders must participate.
● Majority: Consent in both houses is required for a proposal to pass.
4. Dealing with stalemates:
● If a proposal is accepted by only one house, it is considered not approved.
● The proposal may be voted on again through the regular proposal submission
process.
● Recommendation: Before a new vote, the proposal should be adjusted to gain the
approval of both houses.
Security and transparency
1. Verification of player votes:
● “One Player, One Vote” is ensured by on-chain identities and proof of activity.
● Sybil attacks are prevented by AI-based monitoring.
2. Transparency tools:
38
● All votes, budget approvals and decisions are publicly documented and visible to the
community.
Performance reviews and deselection of team members
1. Performance-Reviews:
● Evaluation criteria: Goal achievement, budget adherence, community satisfaction.
● Examination: Quarterly through both houses.
2. Deselection procedure:
● De-voting can be initiated if 10% of players and 10% of $HMON holders support the
request.
● The motion will be presented to both houses.
● Vote: Majority vote in both houses required to vote out a team member.
Frequency of votes and reviews
● Regular votes: New suggestions and updates every month.
● Reviews: Quarterly review of team members and community projects.
● elections: Annual elections for team members and moderators.
Further development of the governance system
● Adjustments: Players can propose changes to the governance model themselves.
● Pilot projects: New mechanisms are introduced on a test basis before being fully
implemented.
Integration with other systems
The governance system is closely linked to the other aspects of Huntmon:
● Technology: Changes to blockchain protocols require community approval.
● Game mechanics: New features or balance adjustments must be approved by the
House of Commons.
● Budget: All financial decisions require the approval of the House of Lords.
Benefits for the community
1. Co-determination: Players and token holders actively shape the development.
39
2. Transparency: Open documentation creates trust.
3. Flexibility: The system adapts to the needs of the community.
4. Sustainability: Democratic control and technical innovation ensure long-term

income and withdrawals.
Measures:
● Legal advice: Close collaboration with international legal experts to meet legal
requirements in key markets.
● Flexibles System: Implement mechanisms that enable regional adjustments, e.g. B.
Geographical restrictions on NFT trading.
● Transparency: Open communication with the community and investors about
possible regulatory restrictions.
2. Market volatility
Description:
● The value of the $MNERG and $HMON tokens could be affected by fluctuations in
the crypto market.
● Negative market sentiment or a slump in the crypto market could reduce the game's
appeal.
Measures:
● External sources of income: Revenue from advertising, sponsorships and
partnerships stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that players can generate income
even when token values are low.
51
● Token-Burning: Using revenue from external sources to buy back and burn tokens
to stabilize token value.
● Flexible Roadmap: The roadmap defined in Chapter 9 can be adapted to changing
market conditions, e.g. B. by moving certain features.

AI-powered pattern recognition and motion sensor validation.
● Community-Reporting: Players can report suspicious activity and receive rewards
for doing so.
● Strict penalties: Violations of the game rules lead to sanctions such as account
suspensions.
5. Community governance and decision making
Description:
● Decentralized governance carries the risk of decision-making stalemate or inefficient
processes.
● Conflicts between different groups of players could lead to tensions.
52
Measures:
● Standoffs: A proposal that is not accepted in both houses is considered rejected.
Adjustments to the proposal may be made through the proposal submission process
to trigger a re-vote.
● Community surveys: Until the full governance system is implemented, regular
surveys will be conducted to incorporate community and investor opinions into
decisions.
● Transparency: Open communication about the decision-making processes
strengthens the trust of the community.
6. Financial insecurities
Description:
● An insufficient budget or unexpectedly high development costs could delay project
implementation.

integrated into the real environment in real time. Light and surface analysis
algorithms ensure that virtual objects interact with the real world in a physically
correct manner.
● Rendering: Unity 3D is used as a development framework to create high-quality and
resource-efficient 3D graphics.
● Interaction options: Players can catch Huntmons by making moves detected by the
camera. This includes grabbing movements, throwing gestures or simple touch
interactions.
● Server communication: AR data is processed locally while the associated metadata
is exchanged between server and app via fast, secure API interfaces.
